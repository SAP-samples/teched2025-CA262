## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session called CA262 - Analyze and optimize front-end application performance.  

## Overview

Apply your optimization skills toward application performance. Learn how to analyze for performance bottlenecks in the front-end of your application and how to identify performance problems. Find out what tools and best practices can help improve your applications based on SAPUI5 or the SAP Fiori design system.
Front-end performance includes several aspects like networking, scripting (parsing and running JavaScript), rendering (both html and CSS), etc. Since this hands-on workshop uses SAPUI5, we will focus on network analysis because the other topics, like rendering, etc, are handled by the framework.
